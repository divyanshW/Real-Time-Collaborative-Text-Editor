# Real-Time Collaborative Text Editor

A real-time collaborative text editor built using Node.js, WebSocket for backend communication, and React/Vue.js for the frontend. This project supports real-time collaboration, conflict resolution, document saving, and version control.

## Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit the document simultaneously.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles conflicts when multiple users modify the same text.
- **Version Control**: Keeps track of changes and allows for document versioning.
- **WebSocket Backend**: Real-time communication between the server and clients.
- **Frontend (React/Vue.js)**: User-friendly interface for editing text documents in real-time.
